    I’m Emily, professionally-trained chef & baker originally from Ireland, and I want to get you Boldly Baking the best dessert recipes, bread, and more with confidence anytime, anywhere.
    I developed the style over the years baking in tiny kitchens all the way to a Michelin-Starred restaurant. It’s about taking risks in the kitchen and being confident that you can create the best results. No special equipment needed, no rare ingredients, just a daring approach to making something impressive for yourself or to share. And you don’t have to be a professional to do it.
    I was born in a small town in the South East of Ireland, and my passion for baking drove me to train as a professional chef before studying with legendary chef Darina Allen at the world-renowned Ballymaloe cookery school in County Cork.

After that I used my new skills as a passport to travel the globe and open doors into the culinary world. I’ve worked as a personal chef in Italy and on the slopes in Australia, but I was drawn to the United States and the possibilities it might hold. Working in bakeries and a Michelin-Starred restaurant in San Francisco, I gained more knowledge and drive to open my own catering business for top tech companies specializing in over-the-top breakfast creations.

Now, along with my co-creator and husband Kevin, I’m pursuing my lifelong dream of teaching people my trade and sharing my culinary adventures and Bold Baking secrets with other Bold Bakers everywhere. We currently live with our one year old son, George, and dog Waffles in Santa Monica, CA.
